Some awesomeness gonna appears in here any soon.

Below some highlighted C code:
{% highlight c linenos %}
int					main( int argc, char * * argv )
{
	(void)fprintf(stdout, "Bonjour le monde !\n");
	/* some comment. */
	return (0);
}
{% endhighlight %}

This `is a code` span!

This para line starts at the first column. However,
      the following lines can be indented any number of spaces/tabs.
   The para continues here.  

  This is another paragraph, not connected to the above one. But  
with a hard line break. \\
And another one.
