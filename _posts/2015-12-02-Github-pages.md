Just jumped into github-pages.

I will do here some sort of soft blog so you can know about my professional personnality.<br />
I am going tell about my jobs responsabilities and in which way that pushes me to be the best I can manage to be.<br />
I also will tell about some personnal projects that I enjoyed to have it done and will sometimes implement it to this site (for the rest of times most of them should be availlable on my [github profile](https://github.com/Hellfar)).

Keep in touch.
